# ReciPlease
The hub to connect with other bright culinary thinkers and develop your taste for food! Here at ReciPlease, we inspire users to share their custom made recipes to the world and encourage their peers and ultimately create a lively space to discuss a passion for food. Our application is essentially a social media platform tailored towards the cooking field as posts are limited to recipes and every profile embodies one's food preference. With this project, we will expand the culinary world to more spaces and help individuals discover new passtimes in quarantine as we strive through this devastating pandemic.

### Features:
**Home** appears after logging into the app through which you are presented with the daily trending recipe posts to get a kickstart on what to cook. Each post is structured with the user's profile image and name on the top followed by the name of the dish, an image, the subcategories it falls under, the number of likes, and lastly the recipe to the dish. The subcategories essentially describe the dish through a simple set of labels. For instance, in this example, we see that the post falls under the breakfast and 15 minute subcategories thereby telling us that it presents a breakfast dish that takes approximately 15 minutes to bake.
**Profile** is where you define yourself as a food specialist. It embodies your stance in the cooking field to give your viewers a good conversation started prior to meeting you.
